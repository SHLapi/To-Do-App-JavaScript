## To-Do App
This is a simple and clean To-Do web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks, adding new items, marking them as complete, and removing them from the list.

Mark as Complete: Click on a task to toggle its completion status, visually indicated by a strikethrough effect.

Remove Tasks: Click the 'X' button next to a task to delete it from the list.

Persistent Storage: Your tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, so they will be available the next time you open the app.

Responsive Design: The application is designed to work well on various screen sizes.
